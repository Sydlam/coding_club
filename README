Meowdy!

Let's get started.
Files like these are important in repositories. If you explore the Dunsmoor Lab org page, you'll find these in every repo. This is where experiment purposes or repo specifications are stated

For coding club purrposes (lol), please be aware of the following in order to keep a clean repo and avoid any branch overwriting

1.) Fork this repository into your own personal branch
            "A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “up-stream” repository. 
              Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, 
              such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository."
      *Do not clone the main repo. Forking it will allow for changes to your own repo that do not affect the main
2.) Once the repo is forked, enter the project under your profile in GitHub & click the green "<> Code" icon
3.) Copy the HTTPS link provided
4.) Open the Anaconda terminal
5.) Use command 'cd' to ensure you are in the desired file path (or current directory)
6.) Enter 
            git clone https://URL-GITHUB-GAVE-YOU
7.) You now have the updated files on your local directory!


To add changes to your branch

1.) Open the terminal
2.) Enter the desired cd path
3.) Enter
  git add .
    *This will populate all files changed in the directory that are to be sent to your forked branch 
4.) Enter 
  git commit -m "Message describing the nature of your changes or additions"
5.) Enter
  git push
  *This sends the gathered files to the GitHub 'cloud' server

To pull files updated from the main repo
For a visualization: https://www.earthdatascience.org/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/git-fork-clone-flow.png
1.) To check what branch you're in, enter:
git remote -v
2.) Enter 
git pull
3.) New files will be added to your local folder and should enumerate with updated changes
